# BANCO — Booking & Stays Review + Maintenance Orders

_Updated: 2026-07-13 · Scope: `artifacts/banco-mobile` (+ notes on api-server & secrets)._
_Latest: M1 (Booking redesign) DONE; full real run of all services verified — see §7 & §8._

This is the honest status handoff. It records **corrected understanding**, an
**inventory** (done / not done / broken), the **secrets audit** (with reasons),
and the **maintenance orders** (gaps written as commands, pending your approval).
Nothing here is hidden.

---

## 0. Corrected understanding (where I was wrong)

1. **The light-blue colour belongs to the Banks & Financiers section — NOT to
   Booking.** It was an alternative accent for the *Banks & Financiers* world
   (`/business/banks`) from an earlier request that was never finished. I wrongly
   applied a navy/blue to the Booking cards. → Blue is now removed from Booking
   (correct). Giving Banks & Financiers its proper blue identity is still an
   **open gap** (see Order M3).
2. **Every card — not only the 4 main Discover cards — should carry an
   expressive background that indicates its section**, in the spirit of the 4
   main Discover cards (no logos; identity via colour + a section-telling
   backdrop). I initially thought only the 4 main cards get this. → StayCard now
   does it, but the rule is **app-wide** across card types (open gap, Order M2).
3. **Booking = residential & furnished RENTAL, never hotels.** (I had this right;
   confirming it explicitly.)
4. **The B reaction has two layers and both must exist** (confirmed working now):
   - single tap = like/save → B turns accent-red, reaches the owner/notifications;
   - long-press = menu with **Potential** (interested affinity) and **not-for-me**.
5. **The Booking page must be genuinely redesigned, not ported.** Reusing the old
   section-search UI carried its old problems (card size/shape, spacing, tall
   search chrome). This is the core open gap (Order M1).

---

## 1. Inventory — DONE (this task, #22)

- **StayCard** (`components/StayCard.tsx`): removed the blue accent → uses the
  real-estate identity accent; photo-forward card (real unit photo as the
  section-indicating background + scrim + overlaid title/location); honest
  `price_display` (verbatim, no client math); **B reaction restored to full
  parity with SmartAssetCard** (tap = save, long-press = Potential/not-for-me);
  bookable ribbon, sponsored badge, share.
- **BookingStaysApp** (`components/search/BookingStaysApp.tsx`): removed the
  always-visible text search rectangle → **tap-to-open search icon** that
  collapses after use; **market-country picker merged inline** with the term
  tabs, smaller/balanced; filters are icon buttons; rental-term tabs are the
  primary segmentation (this subsumes the separate "term chips" request).
- Detail screen `BookingCard` reserve flow still gated on `furnished_daily`;
  `?focus=booking` deep-scroll intact.
- i18n keys present (en + ar). `tsc --noEmit` clean except the pre-existing,
  unrelated `app/(tabs)/profile.tsx` error (tracked separately as compile task).
- No feature deleted; publishing / BANCO Market / the rest of the system untouched.

## 2. Inventory — NOT DONE / needs real work (open gaps)

- **M1 — Booking page true redesign.** It still sits on the old section-search
  foundation. Needs a purpose-built stays layout (correct card proportions,
  spacing, empty/loading states) — a real redesign, not the old UI.
- **M2 — Expressive section backgrounds for ALL card types**, app-wide (not just
  StayCard), following the 4-main-Discover-cards idea; colour + section-telling
  backdrop, no logos.
- **M3 — Banks & Financiers identity** (the unfinished blue-accent request):
  give that section its blue accent + expressive backgrounds.
- **M4 — Glass bottom bar on mini-app search pages** (proposed task #23): keep
  the bottom bar visible but transparent/frosted inside the search area.
- **M5 — Car Import (استيراد السيارات) end-to-end** (proposed task #24).
- **M6 — Maps functional & evolved across every section** (proposed task #25).
- **M7 — Filters redesign** beyond the search box (the FilterSheet itself), so it
  is smaller/cleaner and works correctly in every section.

## 3. Inventory — BROKEN (found; reasons only, not yet fixed)

- **Weekly dealer report emails crash.** `api-server` throws
  `Cannot convert argument to a ByteString … value 1575` in `EmailService.ts`.
  **Reason:** Arabic text is placed into an email/HTTP header (e.g. Subject)
  without RFC-2047 encoding; headers must be Latin-1/ASCII.
- **Paymob checkout cannot be tested.** **Reason:** `PAYMOB_MODE=sandbox` is set
  but no Paymob API/secret/HMAC credentials exist (see §4). (Task #7.)
- **AI features depend on a dev-only endpoint.** `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`
  points at `localhost:1106/modelfarm/...`. **Reason:** the managed-AI sidecar is
  dev-only and is not reachable in a published deployment; a production fallback
  (own `OPENAI_API_KEY`) is needed for any AI-dependent feature in prod.
- **Clerk is on a TEST instance** (`pk_test_…`). **Reason:** dev Clerk keys;
  publishing to production needs a Clerk **production** instance (`pk_live_…`).

## 4. Secrets audit (existence only — values never shown)

**Present & OK:** `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (test),
`VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (test), `RESEND_API_KEY`, `SESSION_SECRET`,
`EXPO_TOKEN`, `DEFAULT_OBJECT_STORAGE_BUCKET_ID`, `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR`,
`PUBLIC_OBJECT_SEARCH_PATHS`, `ADMIN_EMAILS`, `PAYMOB_MODE=sandbox`.

**Missing / needs attention:**
- **Paymob sandbox credentials** — none present (no API key / secret / HMAC).
  Reason: never provided → checkout untestable.
- **Clerk production keys** (`pk_live_…` / matching secret) — only test keys
  exist. Reason: needed for production publish, not for dev.
- **Production AI key** (own `OPENAI_API_KEY`) — absent. Reason: the dev modelfarm
  URL won't work in production.
- `CLERK_PROXY_URL` is empty (referenced by the Expo workflow). Likely optional;
  flag only.

_No secret values were read or printed._

## 5. Maintenance orders — status

You approved M1, M2, M3, M7 to start. Progress below.

| # | Order | Status |
|---|-------|--------|
| M2 | Every card type gets an expressive, section-indicating background app-wide | **DONE** — see §6 |
| M3 | Banks & Financiers blue identity (accent + expressive hero) | **DONE** — see §6 |
| M1 | Redesign the Booking page from scratch (not the old UI) | **DONE** — see §7 |
| M7 | Redesign the filters sheet (smaller, cleaner, works everywhere) | **NEXT — not started** |
| M4 | Glass/transparent bottom bar on mini-app search pages | **CANCELLED** by user (was task #23) |
| M5 | Car Import end-to-end | **CANCELLED** by user (was task #24) |
| M6 | Working, evolved maps for every section | **CANCELLED** by user (was task #25) |
| B1 | Arabic-header crash in weekly report emails (`EmailService.ts`) | **FIXED IN CODE** — needs redeploy only |
| B2 | Add Paymob sandbox credentials | task #7 (needs your creds) |
| #19 | Booking Discover card real photo + rose identity | **DONE** |
| #20 | Rental term chips (daily/monthly/annual) auto | **DONE** (already present as term tabs) |

## 6. Delivered this round (M2 + M3)

- **Shared section-identity system** (`lib/sectionTheme.ts` + `components/SectionBackdrop.tsx`):
  every section now has a colour gradient + a motif icon. `SectionBackdrop` is
  the reusable backdrop.
- **M2 — all three card types** (`SmartAssetCard`, `IndustrialAssetCard`,
  `StayCard`) now fall back to their section's gradient + motif when a listing
  has **no photo** — a card is never a blank grey box again. Photos still show
  when present; nothing else about the cards changed (reactions, memo, prices
  verbatim all intact).
- **M3 — Banks & Financiers is now blue**, not gold: the portal hero is a blue
  gradient banner, the join CTA is blue, and the Discover hub card is blue.
- Code review ran: it caught that my first motif icon names weren't in the
  app's icon registry (would have shown a warning glyph) — **fixed** to
  registry-mapped names. Typecheck clean (except the pre-existing profile.tsx
  compile issue tracked separately).

**Rule for all orders:** no random/partial execution, delete no existing
feature, hide no problem, never block publishing (BANCO Market or elsewhere),
and keep each section conceptually separate and self-evident.

## 7. Delivered this round (M1 — Booking page redesign)

`components/search/BookingStaysApp.tsx` — **presentation rebuilt from scratch,
logic untouched**:

- Replaced the generic marketplace search chrome (three-icon header + separate
  tall search rectangle) with a purpose-built **hospitality "stays" hero** in the
  section's rose real-estate identity (`SectionBackdrop section="real_estate"` as
  the hero background — gradient + faint motif).
- The hero holds: back button, title + subtitle, save-search and filter actions
  (translucent-white; active = solid white with rose icon; filter shows a count
  badge), and a single **"Where to?" search pill** (closed = a `Pressable`
  placeholder, open = a `View` + `TextInput`; this split avoids RN focus quirks
  from wrapping a `TextInput` in a `Pressable`).
- Autocomplete now drops down **directly under the search pill** (previously it
  rendered oddly below the term tabs).
- Rebuilt spacing/proportions; removed all dead header/search styles.
- **All wiring preserved** — search engine (`useSearchMiniApp`), rental-term
  tabs, market-country picker, near-me, save-search, FilterSheet, results
  (`StayCard` via `SearchResultsSurface`), map + map-toggle FAB, exit-confirm.
- Architect code review: **PASS**, no dropped wiring, no regressions.
- `tsc --noEmit` clean (except the pre-existing, unrelated `profile.tsx`).
- **Caveat:** verified by typecheck + review, not a live screenshot — the Expo
  app can't be screenshotted from here.

**Still open:** M7 (FilterSheet redesign). M4/M5/M6 cancelled by user.

## 8. Full real run — verified (2026-07-13)

Brought the whole system up and tested it end-to-end:

- **All 6 workflows running:** api-server (:8080), landing (web), dealer-os
  (:21539), admin-os (:22357), banco-mobile expo (:23351), mockup-sandbox
  (stopped, not needed).
- **Database populated:** 120 **active** listings — car 53, real_estate 36,
  industrial 31; 13 users. No seed needed (seed is non-idempotent — not re-run).
- **Booking has real inventory:** 15 rental (`offer_type=rent`) real-estate
  listings, with varied `rental_term` (furnished_daily, new_law, old_law), so the
  redesigned Booking page and its term tabs show real results.
- **End-to-end feed test PASS:** `GET /api/v1/search?limit=3` on the api-server
  returns real listings JSON, incl. a rental (`price_display: "5K EGP /شهر"`,
  `trust_signal: "Private Seller"`) — honest fields, no client math. DB →
  api-server → feed verified live.

## 9. How to publish (only you can do this)

I can't publish for you — Publish is a button you press, and native mobile
binaries can't be built from the iOS app. When ready, on **replit.com**:

1. Open this project → **Publish**. Replit diffs the dev DB schema to production
   and applies it (post-merge uses `drizzle push-force`).
2. Before a real production launch (not required for a dev/preview publish):
   - **Clerk production keys** (`pk_live_…` + matching secret) — only test keys
     exist today.
   - **Production AI key** (own `OPENAI_API_KEY`) — the dev modelfarm URL won't
     work in prod.
   - **Paymob sandbox creds** if you want to test checkout (task #7).
3. The Arabic-email fix (B1) is already in code; publishing ships it.
4. Native app store build (AAB/IPA) must be done from replit.com, not here.
